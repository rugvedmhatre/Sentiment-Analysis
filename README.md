# Sentiment Analysis
This project aims to develop a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model to analyze the sentiment of movie reviews, determining whether they are positive or negative. By leveraging BERT's powerful contextual understanding of language, the model will be fine-tuned on a labeled dataset of movie reviews to accurately capture the nuances and complexities of human sentiment.

## Code
The project code is present in [this notebook](https://github.com/rugvedmhatre/Sentiment-Analysis/blob/main/bert-sentiment-analysis.ipynb)

## Results
Test Accuracy: **90.02%**
